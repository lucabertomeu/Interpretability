# Global Model-Agnostic Methods

**Global methods describe the average behavior of a machine learning model.** 

## Partial Dependence Plot (PDP)

 A partial dependence plot can show whether the relationship between the target and a feature is linear, monotonic or more complex. For example, when applied to a linear regression model, partial dependence plots always show a linear relationship. The partial dependence function for regression is defined as:
 
$\hat{f}_S(x_S)=E_{X_C}\left[\hat{f}(x_S,X_C)\right]=\int\hat{f}(x_S,X_C)d\mathbb{P}(X_C)$
